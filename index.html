    <p>Certainly! Let’s explore the differences between commands and Bash:
    Commands:
    In general, a command refers to an instruction or action that you provide to the computer’s operating system.
    It can be a simple one-word instruction (like ls to list files) or a more complex sequence of actions.
    Commands can be executed directly in the terminal or shell.
    Bash (Bourne-Again SHell):
    Bash is a specific type of shell—a program that provides a command-line interface for interacting with an operating
    system.
    It is one of the most commonly used Unix/Linux shells and is the default shell in many Linux distributions.
    Bash interprets commands and scripts written in its syntax.
    When you run a Bash script, it executes a series of commands in the order specified.
    Syntax Differences:
    The primary difference lies in how you use them:
    Commands are individual instructions (e.g., ls, mkdir, echo) that you run directly in the terminal.
    Bash is a shell that interprets entire scripts (sequences of commands) written in its syntax.
    Commands are typically short and specific, while Bash scripts can be more complex and involve multiple commands.
    In summary, commands are the building blocks, and Bash is the environment that allows you to write and execute more
    elaborate scripts. Understanding both is essential for effective shell usage</p>
